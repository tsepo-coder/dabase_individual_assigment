SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

I created TT Holdings database. It keeps track of workers, their employers, their employment history, 
and the roles they occupy. After creating the actual database tables and adding sample data, I began 
with a diagram. I created functions for computations, triggers to automate changes, views for various 
perspectives on the data, and procedures for tasks using advanced SQL. Additionally, I created user 
accounts with various levels of access. I recorded the entire procedure. In essence, I demonstrated my 
ability to use the tools by creating a working database.

CHALLENGES 

TT Holdings database construction was fraught with difficulties. First, it took a lot of analytical 
work to properly map the intricate relationships between workers, organizations, jobs, and positions 
in the ER/EER diagram. There was a steep learning curve since the complex SQL components.specifically, 
the triggers, functions, and procedures, required a thorough comprehension of SQL syntax and logic. 
It was challenging to strike a balance between the functional requirements of the project and 
preserving database simplicity, necessitating careful analysis of each feature's implementation.
 Furthermore, careful planning was required because controlling user privileges for safe access
 control was more complicated than expected. Lastly, thorough documentation of the entire process 
took time, but it was essential for future reference and clarity.

HOW I OVER COME THE CHALLENGES

To successfully complete the TT Holdings database project, I had to actively seek out solutions 
to several complex challenges. When grappling with the intricate relationships for the ER/EER diagram,
 I found visual explanations on YouTube channels like "Derek Banas" and "freeCodeCamp.org" incredibly 
helpful; their database design tutorials provided clear, step-by-step guidance. For the advanced SQL 
components, particularly triggers, functions, and procedures, I relied heavily on detailed articles and
 examples from websites like Tutorialspoint and W3Schools. Additionally, the "SQL Tutorial" series on the
 "thenewboston" YouTube channel clarified many of the more nuanced SQL concepts. Balancing the project's
 requirements with database simplicity was achieved through careful planning and iterative development, 
prioritizing core functionalities before adding auxiliary features. For user privilege management, I 
consulted the official MySQL documentation and sought supplementary explanations on forums like 
Stack Overflow.

CONCLUSION 

This project provided a valuable learning experience, significantly enhancing my skillset.
